## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
My main challenge was the designing of the UI such as changing colors and layout styles. Finding where exactly to change these properties took a bit of time and extra research.
Another challenge was calling the Configuration API to get the poster sizes. Since it was mentioned in the videos that the best way to get the poster's url path was through calling the API, I decided to try it on my own.
The challenge was mainly figuring out where I should pass in the received information, whether through the static Movie function or setting each Movie object's field in a setter method. Ultimately I decided to do it through the static
in order to reduce the time spent calling the movies list; hence, the poster paths would be set on the Movie object creation.
Overall, this was a fun starter project to get my feet wet in Android development.
